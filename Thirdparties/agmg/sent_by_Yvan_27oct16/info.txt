Hi,

Attached are the object files, both in integer 64 bit and standard version.

As the sequential version, they need to be linked with damg_mumps.f90.

As you mentioned, mkl is also needed, in fact for BLAS/LAPACK

In parallel environment, it is strongly recommended to use the sequential (non-threaded) version of mkl (link option -lmkl_sequential or so).
Otherwise, mkl will launch multiple threads that will compete with other MPI instances, leading to a significant slow down except if you use only one MPI instance per computing node (in that case, the benefit of multithreaded mkl is tiny, anyway).

Regards,

Yvan
