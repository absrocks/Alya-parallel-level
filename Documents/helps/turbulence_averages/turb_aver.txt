Some requiremenets so that turbulent averages work fine.

1) use constant time step
2) in .dat RUN_TYPE    Frequency has to be idem to the postprocesing frequency of average values.
3) The postprocesisng frequency of all average values has to be the same (my recomendation is that you use STEPO  in ker.dat)
4) If you postprocess averages, for each of the modules where you postprocess averages you must postprocess at leat the correspondig value
      nastin : AVVEL
      nastal : AVVEL
      turbul : AVTVI
      temper : AVTEM
see  if( mod(ittim, postp(1) % npp_stepi(21) ) == 0 ) then  in nsi_output and similar lines in the rest of modules.
