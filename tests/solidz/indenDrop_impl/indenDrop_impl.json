    "description": "This test validates the use of gravity loads, initial velocities and the calculation of the energies using the Implicit Dynamic scheme. The model consists of a body-weight drop (indenter) at a defined height with an initial velocity. The aim of the problem is that the indenter reaches an energy of 35J at the origin of the global coordinate system.",
