    "description": "This test validates the damage law for fibre breakage (d1+) by using the constitutive model 152. The model consist of a cube 1x1x1mm with fibres parallel to the loading direction (0 degrees ply respect to the reference). The cube is divided in two regions or materials: center (with damage) and each side (elastic). Alya Implicit integration scheme is used.",
