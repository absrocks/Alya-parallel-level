    "description": "This test validates the state variables of the 2-d cohesive element formulated by Turon et. al 2018. The model consist of one cohesive element between two QUA04 elements. The boundary conditions are imposed at the bulk material: the bottom nodes are fixed while the top nodes a controlled displacement is imposed. The cohesive element is loaded and unloaded with the following cycle load: (1) critical strength in Mode I, 80MPa; (2) dissipation half of the critical fracture energy; (3) unloading to its origin; (4) contact stage; (5) dissipation of the remaining energy; and (6) displacement after completely element damage.",
