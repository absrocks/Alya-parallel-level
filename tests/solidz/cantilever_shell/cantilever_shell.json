    "description": "Cantilever beam under distributed end load. \r It is a non-elastic bending test. It is a clamped plate subjected to end load. The beam is very thin so it is modelled using continuum shells and an isotropic constitutive law. The tip displacement is almost 7 meters (compare to the 10 meters of the beam). \r It uses fields to impose distributed forces on the edge. ",
