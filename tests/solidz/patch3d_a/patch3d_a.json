    "description": "This 3D patch test verifies the correctness of the computer implementation of the 8-node hexahedral element, using a quasi-static implicit algorithm. This validation was performed against Code_Aster and Ostero codes, taken as reference an uniaxial displacement test case. A detailed explanation can be found in the technical report called \"Solidz benchmarked\" written by Guido Giuntoli. This report is located in the documentation section of solidz's Redmine project.",
