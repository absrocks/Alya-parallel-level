    "description": "This 3D patch test verifies the correctness of the computer implementation of the 8-node hexahedral element, using an explicit algorithm without artificial damping. This validation was taken from the paper by Areias et. al., \"Analysis of 3D problems using a new enhanced strain hexahedral element\". The case C presented in this paper is taken as reference, where a displacement field is imposed at the exterior nodes.",
