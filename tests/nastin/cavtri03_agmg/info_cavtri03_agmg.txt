- contrary to nastin/cavtri03 here I compare .ensi instead of post.res for 2 reasons.
1) With ensi supposedly you can use tolerance. This for me is much better. When the case fails,
one looks at it and accepts the changes are small. Nowadays what we do is change the svn base because we are comparing with diff.
Instead, it would be better to change the tolerance and leave the svn base unaltered. 
In this way if a new difference appears but it is below the tolerance it will not fail.
For the moment I will set the difference to a very small value: 1.0e-12
2) The second reason to use ensi is that in this way the time does not appear.
Since TIME_COUPLING:          Global, From_critical is used and at each time step the solver is not fully converged.
The time is not identical with different number of processors. This is ok but it would give an error if post.res are compared. 

Further, Guillaume also has cavtri03_agmg-boundary.nsi.set  cavtri03_agmg.nsi.wit but since they have the time
I prefer to avoid them. Moreover, they have results over all the time steps, not just the last one. It is not correct
to compare results over all time steps if each step is not fully converged. 

So the files to compare are:
cavtri03_agmg.ensi.PRESS-000001
cavtri03_agmg.ensi.PRESS-000002
cavtri03_agmg.ensi.VELOC-000001
cavtri03_agmg.ensi.VELOC-000002

with tolerance 1e-12 for the 000002 files and tolerance 1e-15 for the 000001 files.

I do not want 1p, 4p  & 5p. All must compare against a single folder.

Finally the file cavtri03_agmg.post.alyadat must be included. (needed for alya2pos)
