    "description": "This tests checks if the Coriolis and Centrifigual forces together with no inertial boundary conditions\nare well implemented. It solves the flow in a 2D circle in a rotating frane of reference (angular velocity w)\nand with a Dirichlet boundary condition u = -w x r on the wall. The exact linear solution is therefore\nu = - w x r together with p = cst (here the constant is set to unity).",
