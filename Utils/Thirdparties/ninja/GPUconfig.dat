0.9,0,2

!!!!------Set the above 3 parameters in order------
1. Factor of GPU memory to be used. Ideal would be 0.8/0.9
2. GPU Direct RDMA, use 1 to enable. Make sure the MPI and network cards support the feature
3. Sparse solver type. (0 for NVIDIA cusparse, 1 for Vectorized version and 2 for WARP based version).
   Best performance in most cases by version 2
