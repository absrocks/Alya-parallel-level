alya2vtk: mesh converter from Alya format to VTK (ASCII)
Very useful if you want to visualize a mesh without running Alya 
So far it only works for 3D meshes with tetrahedral elements. 
--Requirement: python interpreter and paraview (or similar) to visualize the vtk file
--To print the usage: ./alya2vtk.py -v or python alya2vtk.py -v
Check the examples 
This converter is under development so if you need an extension for 2D meshes or other type of elements please contact me!
