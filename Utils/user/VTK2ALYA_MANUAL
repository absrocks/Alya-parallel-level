MANUAL TO INTERPOLATE SOLUTIONS FROM EXTERNAL DATA

The scripts can be found in:

Alya/Thirdparties/libple/PLEPP/Tools/VTK

 ------- alya2vtu.py -------

Create mesh from a vtu (vtk unstructured) file (this is the target mesh) 
   1. Include the path of the mesh in:

       ALYA_PTs = "../mesh_2d/fort.777"
       ALYA_ELEMs = "../mesh_2d/fort.777"
       ALYA_TYPES = "../mesh_2d/fort.777"
       being fort.777 the name.geo file.

   2. *.vtu file with the mesh is created.


 ------- vtu2alya.py -------

It reads and extracts the information from the *.vtu file to obtain:

     (1) Geometry in Alya format
     (2) Extract the variables contained in the *.vtu files to create fields that
         can be used in Alya as initial condition.


 ------- Initialization of Alya using external data using paraview -------
         (meshes do not need to be identical, so  
         coarse to fine and fine to coarse should wok)
 

  1. Running the python script alya2vtu.py --> geo_mesh.vtu file is created: this is the targeted mesh.
  2. In Paraview, load the two meshes (geo_mesh.vtu and the external mesh) 
  3. Use Paraview filter 'Resample with dataset' (the source mesh should be the external mesh)
  4. Save the mesh with the interpolated solution in *.vtu format.
  5. Use the python script vtu2alya.py to create the fields required to start the simulations

  Enjoy!!
